# Will it Python?

- Updated Dec 1, 2012

## Introduction
*Will it Python?* programs are ports of data analyses originally done in R into Python. The projects are accompanied by a series of blog posts documenting the porting-process. See http://slendrmeans.wordpress.com/will-it-python for more information.

## Projects:
The code is organized into subfolders by translation project. The projects so far are:

1. MLFH: _Machine Learning for Hackers_ by Drew Conway and John Myles White.

## Python and library versions:
The code is written for Python 2.7. Third party libraries used in projects are:
    - Numpy 1.7.0h2
    - Scipy 0.11.0
    - matplotlib 1.1.2
    - pandas 0.9.1
    - statsmodels 0.5.0 (dev)
    - NLTK 2.0.4
    - scikit-learn 0.12.1

I'm also using IPython 0.13 to create the IPython notebooks. 

These packages will be updated over time. Scripts/notebooks will usually indicate what version of a library they were first coded in. If unspecified, it's usually safe to assume the latest stable version will work.

## IPython Notebooks:
The earlier chapters contain both IPython notebooks and python scripts of the code. Since I started the project, the IPython notebooks have gained more widespread use, so I'm typically providing only those. From the notebook, it's not difficult to export to a python script, but some code (especially plotting) may not be designed for scripting.
